CHECK INPUT:

Study data were read from input.txt
The 2 variables observed in 2 studies are ['Cancer', 'Test']
The pooled sample size is 170. Sample sizes determine study weights.

Study 0 with weight 0.4118 constraints:

P( Cancer ) = 0.1

Study 1 with weight 0.5882 constraints:

P( Test ) = 0.5
P( Cancer & Test | Test ) = 0.4

OUTPUT:

The resulting distribution after 55 iterations is [0.5257, 0.3154, 0.0000, 0.1588]
The sum of weighted KL-divergences of this distribution to sets of probability functions given by individual studies is: 0.009502267271782156
This sum is what is being minimised. The last improvement to this sum was by 8.834186312860204e-08 < 1e-07 = stopping

Assuming that all available evidence was provided, that studies are either homogeneous or it is unknown why they are heterogeneous, and the population size is much larger than the pooled sample size, then the following is among the best estimations of probabilities we can make.

P( Cancer ) = 0.1588
P( NOT Cancer ) = 0.8412
P( Test ) = 0.4743
P( NOT Test ) = 0.5257
P( Cancer & Test ) = 0.1588
P( Cancer & NOT Test ) = 0.0000
P( NOT Cancer & Test ) = 0.3154
P( NOT Cancer & NOT Test ) = 0.5257

To find the probability of a disjunction use the above with P( X OR Y ) = P( X ) + P( Y ) - P( X & Y ).

To find the probability of a conditional use the above with P( X | Y ) = P( X & Y ) / P( Y ).
