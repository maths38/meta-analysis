This log file shows how the procedure converged to the output shown in output.txt
Please make sure to resolve any warnings given to you in output.txt

The maxiter parameter when computing projections is 2000 Increase it if you receive a warning to that end.
The gtol parameter when computing projections is 1e-13 You may lower it but not below 1e-13 to increase the maximal achievable level of precision.

Iteration 0: [0.25000, 0.25000, 0.25000, 0.25000] Divergence: 0.3680642071684969 Difference: 9.631935792831504 < 1e-07 = stopping
Iteration 1: [0.45000, 0.45000, 0.05000, 0.05000] Divergence: 0.0 Difference: 0.3680642071684969 < 1e-07 = stopping
Iteration 2: [0.45000, 0.45000, 0.05000, 0.05000] Divergence: 0.0 Difference: 0.0 < 1e-07 = stopping

Individual non-weighted KL-divergences from the resulting distribution [0.4500, 0.4500, 0.0500, 0.0500] to studies are respectively to Study 0: 0.0, to Study 1: 0.15561933979154913, where smaller values indicate smaller divergences. This could be used to judge the degree to which the individual studies disagree with the resulting distribution, and as a basis of reliability analysis.
